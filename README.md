# hello-world
Practice/refresher to prep for more open source contributions!
---------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there! I've used GitHub and Git before, but I haven't made any open source contributions... yet :-) Like for other first-timers, it's scary, so I thought following the GitHub Guide for the "Hello World" project would help ease me into the process.

Wish me luck... Happy Coding everyone!
